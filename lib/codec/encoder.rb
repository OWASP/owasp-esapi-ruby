# The Encoder interface contains a number of methods for decoding input and encoding output
# so that it will be safe for a variety of interpreters. To prevent
# double-encoding, callers should make sure input does not already contain encoded characters
# by calling canonicalize. Validator implementations should call canonicalize on user input
# <b>before</b> validating to prevent encoded attacks.
# All of the methods must use a "whitelist" or "positive" security model.
# For the encoding methods, this means that all characters should be encoded, except for a specific list of
# "immune" characters that are known to be safe.
# The Encoder performs two key functions, encoding and decoding. These functions rely
# on a set of codecs that can be found in the org.owasp.esapi.codecs package. These include:
# * CSS Escaping<
# * HTMLEntity Encoding
# * JavaScript Escaping
# * MySQL Escaping
# * Oracle Escaping
# * Percent Encoding (aka URL Encoding)
# * Unix Escaping
# * VBScript Escaping
# * Windows Encoding

      # Sanitization is simply the operation of reducing a possibly encoded
      # string down to its simplest form. This is important, because attackers
      # frequently use encoding to change their input in a way that will bypass
      # validation filters, but still be interpreted properly by the target of
      # the attack. Note that data encoded more than once is not something that a
      # normal user would generate and should be regarded as an attack.
      # Everyone says[http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/180.html] you shouldn't do validation
      # without canonicalizing the data first. This is easier said than done. The canonicalize method can
      # be used to simplify just about any input down to its most basic form. Note that sanitization doesn't
      # handle Unicode issues, it focuses on higher level encoding and escaping schemes. In addition to simple
      # decoding, sanitize also handles:
      # * Perverse but legal variants of escaping schemes
      # * Multiple escaping (%2526 or &#x26;lt;)
      # * Mixed escaping (%26lt;)
      # * Nested escaping (%%316 or &%6ct;)
      # * All combinations of multiple, mixed, and nested encoding/escaping (%2&#x35;3c or &#x2526gt;)
      #
      # Although ESAPI is able to canonicalize multiple, mixed, or nested encoding, it's safer to not accept
      # this stuff in the first place. In ESAPI, the default is "strict" mode that throws an IntrusionException
      # if it receives anything not single-encoded with a single scheme. Even if you disable "strict" mode,
      # you'll still get warning messages in the log about each multiple encoding and mixed encoding received.

      # Encode for an operating system command shell according to the configured OS codec

      # Please note the following recommendations before choosing to use this method:
      #
      # 1. It is strongly recommended that applications avoid making direct OS system calls if possible as such calls are not portable, and they are potentially unsafe. Please use language provided features if at all possible, rather than native OS calls to implement the desired feature.
      # 2. If an OS call cannot be avoided, then it is recommended that the program to be invoked be invoked directly (e.g., Kernel.system("nameofcommand","parameterstocommand")) as this avoids the use of the command shell. The "parameterstocommand" should of course be validated before passing them to the OS command.
      # 3. If you must use this method, then we recommend validating all user supplied input passed to the command shell as well, in addition to using this method in order to make the command shell invocation safe.
