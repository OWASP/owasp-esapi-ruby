== Introduction

The Owasp Esapi Ruby is a port for outstanding release quality Owasp Esapi
project to the Ruby programming language. 

The idea is to build a Ruby gem containing the Esapi concepts
implemented in Ruby classes so people using Ruby in their Rails application
can have security into them.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
