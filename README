= The Owasp ESAPI Ruby project

== Introduction

The Owasp ESAPI Ruby is a port for outstanding release quality Owasp ESAPI
project to the Ruby programming language. 

Ruby is now a famous programming language due to its Rails framework developed by David Heinemeier Hansson (http://twitter.com/dhh) that simplify the creation of a web application using a convention over configuration approach to simplify programmers' life.

Despite Rails diffusion, there are a lot of Web framework out there that allow people to write web apps in Ruby (merb, sinatra, vintage) [http://accidentaltechnologist.com/ruby/10-alternative-ruby-web-frameworks/]. Owasp Esapi Ruby wants to bring all Ruby deevelopers a gem full of Secure APIs they can use whatever the framework they choose.

== Why supporting only Ruby 1.9.2 and beyond?

=== Regular expression engine
(to be written)

=== Dates and Time
From "Programming Ruby 1.9"

"As of Ruby 1.9.2, the range of dates that can be represented is no longer limited by the under- lying operating system’s time representation (so there’s no year 2038 problem). As a result, the year passed to the methods gm, local, new, mktime, and utc must now include the century—a year of 90 now represents 90 and not 1990."

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
